Plugin for Gravity Forms to generate a running total of a form on a specific field.

== Description ==
This plugin strictly gives you a shortcode to specify a Gravity Form ID, and a Field within that form to take all of the submitted fields and totals them and spits out the total.  The shortcode looks like this: Usage: [gfrt id="1" field="3"]. For this example, if you have a form of the ID 1, and the third field is a number, it will grab all of them and give you a total.
